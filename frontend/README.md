## Setup and Run the Vite App

1. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up the environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variable:

   ```env
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

   This specifies the backend URL for your app.

3. **Run the development server**:

   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the app**:

   Once the development server is running, open your browser and go to:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

   This is where your Vite app will be available.
